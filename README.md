# DjangoExperiment

This is a coding experiment to build a functional website backend (Might or Might not end up including a frontEnd)

TODO:
-Website should work (Not throw exceptions when lauching)
-Website should allow user register and Log In
-The main idea is to create a task management service (Like dollar store google tasks)
